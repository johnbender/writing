The following is a selection of my best work. It includes essays available elsewhere on this site, video recordings of recent presentations and links to more information on projects that I'm involved in.

## Writing

[Faster JavaScript with Category Theory](/2012/02/09/faster-javascript-through-category-theory/) - This post covers my initial work on formalizing the relationship between vanilla DOM manipulation functions and jQuery methods using Category Theory. It forms the basis for one talk and two essays.

[A Natural Transformation in JavaScript](/2012/03/22/a-natural-transformation-in-javascript/) - A natural transformation was a logical progression after constructing two categories and a functor in the previous writing on JavaScript and Category Theory.

[Splitting jQuery in Two, A Propsal](/2012/07/19/splitting-jquery-in-two-a-proposal/) - The relationship between the categories <b>Html</b> and <b>Jqry</b> highlighted a logical division of responsibility for jQuery methods. The result is better performance and a more modular architecture for the library.

## Open Source

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) - Vagrant is a tool to make virtualizing development evironments entirely painless. This has many benefits like deployment environment parity, fast developer onboarding, and easy deployment testing. My involvement has been limited recently but I am the co-creator of this project.

[jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) - jQuery Mobile is a UI kit and collection of browser fixes that make developing cross browser mobile web applications easy. I am currently employed by Adobe Systems as a development lead on this project.

[Wield](https://github.com/johnbender/wield) - Wield is the realization of the proposal made in [Splitting jQuery in Two, A Propsal](/2012/07/19/splitting-jquery-in-two-a-proposal/). It is a collection of very simple DOM manipulation methods that can be used at the core of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods. The primary project goals are modularity, compact size, and minimal JavaScript overhead for DOM manipulation.

## Talks

[Progressive Enhancement on the Mobile Web](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Mobile-Web-Development) - The mobile web is populated by an incredibly diverse set of browsers with wide ranging capabilities. In this light hearted talk I discuss some of the more difficult and subtle issues confronting developers working on the mobile web and present some solutions used in jQuery Mobile.

[Faster JavaScript with Category Theory](/2012/08/26/presentation-faster-javascript-through-category-theory/) - After refining the results in three essays I created a thirty minute presentation around my thoughts on Category Theory and JavaScript. I gave the talk most recently at JSCONFEU in Berlin to approximately 200 developers.

[Middleware as General Purpose Abstraction](/2012/04/28/middleware-as-a-general-purpose-abstraction/) - When Mitchell Hashimoto and I created Vagrant we eventually used a modified version of the middleware described in [PEP333](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/) to compose actions over virtual machines. For more information on Vagrant itself see the section on Open Source.
