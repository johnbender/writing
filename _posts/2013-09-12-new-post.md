The 26th is the first day of instruction in the first academic year of my PhD in Computer Science at UCLA. I've been asked, variously by my mother, friends, and colleagues, why I want to get a PhD but I rarely get a chance to explain my thinking completely. Hopefully this post will serve as a better account of why I want to get a PhD and in part as a weak counterpoint to the fairly popular opinion that there isn't much value in academia and higher education where Computer Science and engineering are concerned.

## Why Bother?

Whenever someone seems confused or surprised by my decision to go back to school it seems to boil down to a relatively reasonable idea: any professional success or gains I would otherwise have garnered while getting my PhD are of greater absolute value than the education I will be getting.

This comes in many reasonable forms. Why are you leaving such a high paying job? Will you be able to speak at conferences? When will you find time to contribute to open source? Couldn't you just work on those ideas in your free time? These questions are generally asked directly and with genuine interest in the response.

Less directly, there is a sense that academia and higher eduction are loosing a lot of their "value". Why would anyone waste their time getting a PhD when there are people without any higher education earning comparable salaries and working on important projects? Though I never hear this asked straight out, it comes through in a lot of my conversations and the idea that education is unimportant in the software "meritocracy" is pervasive.

## Career Path

When I got my first legitimate management position as the director of engineer at a consultancy/incubator it became clear very quickly that management wasn't for me.

I enjoyed seeing my teammates succeed. I enjoyed building and refining our process. I enjoyed winning business. I enjoyed the subtleties of communicating complex technical ideas to people with all types of backgrounds and experience.

The thing that really got to me was the amount of time I spent staring at my email client. After about a year I really missed the technical aspects of the job, and I started to think about my long term career options.

As I see it, there are three paths you can take when you are up for management positions that don't route back through school.

1. **Avoid title advancement and stick with engineering** This was, at least initially, the path I took. I left for Adobe and a position working full time on jQuery Mobile.
2. **Grab the title and climb the ladder** Management positions pay a lot of money, and there's a lot of room for advancement. Not all require you to hand over your keyboard.
3. **Employee Number One or Co-Founder** First employee/Co-Founder positions are available for experienced "generalists" as far as I can tell. This is purely based on personal observations and conversation with friends who are better informed on the topic.

There are, of course, a lot of subtle variants to these larger themes but this was my assessment at the time. The choice for me was relatively easy since I was offered an OSS position at Adobe but in retrospect my interests have served as a pretty sure guide.

## What Interests Me

The things that keep me working up past midnight are technical. Problems both large and small that remain unsolved or where the solution is unsatisfactory. A short and incomplete list:

* Descriptive declarative languages that aren't
* System configuration and state management (or lack thereof)
* Adoption, understanding, and value of advanced type systems
* Direct applications of mathematics to programming languages and tools
* JavaScript and The Browser as a development platform

More generally, it's the details that I'm interested in; the minutiae, the corner cases and their implications. When I find a problem that interests me I want to think about it and work with it until I've uncovered something valuable or concluded that I'm not capable of improving on the existing thinking and solutions.

Of the three "paths" I outlined above only the first really supports this. Even then it's highly dependent on the company you work for. Frequently you work on problems that have debatable long term value, and you're always coping with unfortunate engineering details.

## What Doesn't Interest Me

As a web developer and someone who's worked almost exclusively on the client side for the last few years I have a fairly long list of things that do not interest me or are an active source of frustration. Nearly all of them would be impossible to describe as "general".

* Esoteric browser bugs (yes they still exist in abundance)
* The culture/necessity of JavaScript micro-libraries
* Effort required to provide broad access to web based content
* Dynamic programming languages as an industry default
* Non-transferable esoterica (e.g., how iptables works on CentOS, Chef's attribute resolution order)
* Large JavaScript projects

I'm not above working on these problems. For a web developer many of these are simply facts of life. I'm just not content to let them bother me indefinitely which means contribute to solutions or move on.

## On Academia



## The Fourth Path

Taking all of this into account, it was pretty clear to me even before I went to Adobe that I wanted to go back to school. At the other end of a PhD I hope there's a research position for me where my interests align with the companies needs and I can publish while providing value.
